"""Links evidence passages back to the user's own highlights.

`connection_evidence.highlight_id` is what makes a passage "yours": it drives the
`yours`/`AI-suggested` badge in review, the "starred" flag on the memo page, and whether a
starred highlight counts as assigned. Every path that writes evidence (AI review, a
connection added in review, a memo-page evidence edit) runs its spans through
`resolve_evidence` so the link is set the same way everywhere.

Matching is by overlap, not exact span equality: the model (or the user) rarely cites
exactly the words that were highlighted, and a passage that shares any word with a
highlight on the same snippet is the user's highlight being cited. Spans are half-open
word ranges [start_index, end_index), the same convention as highlight_snippet.
