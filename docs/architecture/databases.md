# Databases

The app uses two SQLite files and no Postgres or Supabase. The PRD's Postgres assumption is
corrected in `docs/prototype-log.md`.

| | Cortico snapshot (source data) | Prototype database (the app's store) |
|---|---|---|
| File | `acp_pipeline_snapshot.db` at the repo root (146 MB, gitignored) | `db/prototype.db` (gitignored) |
| Config key (`backend/config.yaml`) | `cortico_db_path: "../acp_pipeline_snapshot.db"`, resolved relative to `backend/` | `prototype_db_path: "db/prototype.db"`, resolved relative to the repo root |
| Env override | none | `PROTOTYPE_DB_PATH` (`get_config` in `backend/app/config.py`) |
| Engine (`backend/app/db.py`) | `cortico_engine`: `mode=ro&immutable=1&uri=true`, plus `PRAGMA query_only = ON` on connect | `prototype_engine`: `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` on connect |
| Declarative base | `CorticoBase` (`models_cortico.py`) | `PrototypeBase` (`models_prototype.py`) |
| FastAPI dependency | `get_cortico_db` | `get_prototype_db`. The transcription thread opens `PrototypeSession()` directly. |

## Cortico models (read-only)

Organization, Community, Forum, Project, Participant, Conversation, Snippet,
ConversationGuide, GuideSection and GuideQuestion. `db/schema.sql` is this snapshot's schema,
generated with `sqlite3 acp_pipeline_snapshot.db ".schema"`. It is a reference for checking
names and is never executed.

Snapshot facts the code depends on (`docs/prototype-log.md`):
- Only 1 of the 54 projects (project 5) has a conversation guide.
- No conversation has a `conversation_guide_id` set. The guide is resolved by
  `backend/app/guide.py`: use `conversation_guide_id` if set, else the project's
  highest-`version` guide.
- None of the 201 conversations has an `audio_url`.
- Conversations 160, 162 and 201 have zero snippets.
- Snippet ids are integers; there is no uuid.

## Prototype tables

`research_question`, `rl_highlight`, `highlight_snippet`, `voice_memo`,
`reflection_connection`, `connection_evidence`, `reflection_connection_revision`,
`transcript_state`, `section_checkpoint`, `conversation_gist`, `next_step_suggestion`,
`code_family`, `code_family_member`, `code_family_merge_suggestion`, `app_setting`.

## Schema lifecycle

- There are no migrations. `PrototypeBase.metadata.create_all` runs in three places: the
  lifespan in `backend/app/main.py`, `scripts/backfill_gists.py`, and `tests/conftest.py`.
  It creates missing tables and never alters existing ones.
- A new table is additive: check its name against `db/schema.sql`, then log it in
  `docs/prototype-log.md`.
- A new or changed column on an existing table needs a migration that doesn't exist. Stop
  and ask the user how to apply it. Never wipe `db/prototype.db`, because it holds real dev
  data.
- Startup also runs `seed_research_questions` (`backend/app/seed.py`). It loads the 3 RQs
  in `backend/seed/research_questions.seed.json`, but only when user 101 has no RQs yet.

## Invariants

- Never write through `CorticoSession` or a Cortico model, because the snapshot is source
  data. The engine refuses writes anyway.
- Rejecting, dismissing, merging or retracting a row sets a status. Rows are never deleted,
  because the trail must stay auditable.
- `section_checkpoint` has a unique constraint on (user, conversation, guide question), and
  `PUT /conversations/{id}/checkpoints` upserts against it. The question must belong to the
  conversation's resolved guide.
- Audio uploads go to `audio_dir: "db/local/audio"`, which `main.py` serves at `/audio`.
- `db/local/exports/` is the user's hand-made backup. No code reads or writes it.
