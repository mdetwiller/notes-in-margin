# Routers

All routers live in `backend/app/routers/` and are registered in `backend/app/main.py`.
`GET /health` lives in `main.py`. CORS allows only `http://localhost:5173`. Routes marked
**paid** call OpenAI.

| Router | Method and path | Handler |

| | `GET /voice_memos/{voice_memo_id}/review` | `get_review` |
| | `POST /voice_memos/{voice_memo_id}/file` | `file_to_memo` (the only way into the memo) |

| | `GET /research_questions/{rq_id}/code_families/state` | `code_family_state` |
| | `POST /research_questions/{rq_id}/code_families/synthesize?override_cap=` | `synthesize` (**paid**; returns the state object, not a list) |
| | `PATCH /code_families/{family_id}` | `update_family` |
| | `POST /code_families/{family_id}/accept` | `accept_family` |
| | `POST /code_families/{family_id}/dismiss` | `dismiss_family` |

## Cross-cutting rules

- **Single user:** every user-scoped read and write uses `config.default_user_id` (101).
  There is no auth.
- **Request bodies** are Pydantic models in `backend/app/schemas.py`. Responses are dicts
  built by each router's `_serialize*` helpers.
- **Expected errors** are `HTTPException`, with a `{"detail": ...}` body.
- **Adding a route** means also adding its `api.*` method in `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` and
  its response type in `frontend/src/lib/types.ts`.
