# Frontend

The frontend is React 19, react-router-dom 7, Vite 8, TypeScript ~6 and oxlint (see
`frontend/package.json`). There are no frontend tests.

## Talking to the backend (`frontend/src/lib/api.ts`)

- `BASE = "http://localhost:8000"` is hard-coded, and `vite.config.ts` has no proxy, so the
  app depends on the backend's CORS setting for `http://localhost:5173`.
- Every backend route has one method on the exported `api` object. Calls use plain `fetch`;
  the JSON content-type is set unless the body is `FormData`.
- Any non-OK response throws `Error("<status> <path>: <body>")`.
- `audioUrlFor` keeps only the file's basename, so audio must sit flat in `db/local/audio`.

## Types (`frontend/src/lib/types.ts`)

These types mirror the dicts each router's `_serialize*` helpers build, not
`backend/app/schemas.py`. When a backend response shape or status value changes, update the
matching type in the same PR, because nothing checks them against each other.

## Routes (`frontend/src/App.tsx`)

| Path | Page | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | `ReaderPage` | `?conversation=N` picks the transcript, and `&snippet=ID` scrolls to and outlines a snippet. `MAX_VOICE_MEMO_SECONDS = 1200` must match `voice_memo.max_duration_seconds` in `backend/config.yaml`. |
| `/memo` | `MemoPage` | Memo entries, next steps, code families and merge suggestions |
| `/settings` | `SettingsPage` | View, edit, save and reset the review prompt |

## Components (`frontend/src/components/`)

- `TranscriptView`: words and highlights.
- `HoverSectionMenu`: section checkpoints.
- `SidePanel`: the RQ tab and a compact memo.
- `EndOfTranscriptPrompt`: the prompt shown once at the end of a transcript.
- `LeaveConfirmationDialog`: guards only the transcript switcher; the top-nav links aren't
  guarded.
- `ReflectionPanel`: recording, upload, and polling transcription every 700 ms.
- `ReviewStep`: accept, edit or reject proposals, assign starred highlights, and file.

## Behaviour to keep

- Review is best-effort: if `runReview` fails, `ReaderPage` falls back to
  `GET /voice_memos/{id}/review`. Never re-run the review on resume, because that would
  duplicate suggestions.
- `npm run lint` currently exits 0 with 9 warnings, in `ReflectionPanel.tsx`
  (no-unused-expressions), `ReaderPage.tsx` and `MemoPage.tsx` (set-state-in-effect,
  exhaustive-deps). Don't add new ones.
